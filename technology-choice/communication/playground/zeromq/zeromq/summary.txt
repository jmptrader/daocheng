# Install of zmq and it's java binding.

jzmq.jar depends on  libzmq (C implementation) and libjzmq (Java Binding with dynamic library file)

libzmq install failed with following error:
***** error: Package requirements (libsodium) were not met:.
 
workaround-> install sodium first:
  https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/ -> working
  
Run the program:

   -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib
 
***** Even with both libjzmq and libzmq built and installed in /usr/local/lib, the program can still not been running.


Fallback plan:
 -> use jeromq (Java native implementation of zeromq)
